# BSC-Notes
Test job for BSC

Notes application using Android Jetpack (MVVM, AndroidX, ViewModel, LiveData), Koin, Retrofit

Because the provided API (https://note10.docs.apiary.io) is just mock and doesn't show app's UX, there is also product flavour with changed API service (bsc is with mocked API, mock is for working localhost API)

Command for making and installing https://note10.docs.apiary.io version:
```
./gradlew installBscDebug
```

Command for making and installing localhost version:
```
./gradlew installMockDebug
```

Hope you will enjoy the app and code
